					Hard working, committed, driven, are some of the many quality's I have gained over the years.
					I strive towards the highest coding standard when developing code. Syntax of a language, Memory Management,
					as well as version control are some of my main focuses. Some of my great achievements to this date are a 
					fully functional poker hand evaluator, as well as an independent game I made with a simulated fluctuating stock market.
					My main goal is to evolve to the highest standard of production C++ code. Some examples of my coding will be located
					in the projects section <a href="../Projects/projects.html">here</a>.
					
					<br></br>
					I've done a ton of hard work in my days. I have 5 years building barns, and a couple more years doing concrete and cabinets.
					In between my construction life I graduated from a 2 year police foundations program at Fanshawe College. Life threw me a curve
					ball one day while I was building a barn. I broke through a 2x4 falling 30 feet and almost died, doctors said I should of been paralysed.
					While the accident changed my outlook on life, it also set me on a new direction for a career in a field that has always been a hobby to me.
					My experience on a computer extends throughout my entire life, from making flash games in high school, to over clocking CPU's for fun. 
					My knowledge of construction helps me to this day while I code. I know that it takes a ton of hard work and determination to build a barn 
					from the ground up, this is the exact mentality i have while developing.
